# Black Goose Bistro | Pizza-on-Demand

## Task Overview

This is an HTML-only project created as part of the ITI Web Development Track.  
The task focuses on practicing HTML basics, semantic tags, and form elements without using any CSS or JavaScript.

## Project Description

The project is a simple Pizza Ordering Web Page for the fictional restaurant Black Goose Bistro.

The page includes:

- Header and Navigation Bar with links:
  - Main
  - Make an Order
  - Contact Us

- Main Section with:
  - Restaurant name and description.
  - Two main fieldsets (forms):
    1. User Information: collects name, address, phone, email, and delivery instructions.
    2. Pizza Design: allows users to:
       - Choose crust type (Radio buttons).
       - Choose multiple toppings (Checkboxes).
       - Enter the number of pizzas.

- Submit and Reset Buttons.

## Semantic HTML Tags Used

- `<header>` : Contains the website navigation.
- `<nav>` : Contains navigation links.
- `<main>` : Wraps the main content of the page.
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` : Group related form elements.
- `<label>` : Defines labels for form inputs.

## How to Run

1. Open the `.html` file using any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
2. No server or setup is required as this is a pure HTML static page.

## Notes

No CSS used (as required by the task).  
All form elements are functional but without backend submission.  
The structure follows Semantic HTML5 best practices.
